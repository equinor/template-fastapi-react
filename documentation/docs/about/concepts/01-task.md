This is an example of a "concept" which is domain specific, and not related to your application. It should be replaced by relevant domain specific concepts in your documentation. Note that for some concepts, having an "Examples"-section does not make sense. Feel free to adapt the example's structure to best suit your concepts.

A task is piece of work which is assigned to be done by one or multiple persons. A task usually has defined limits, often referred to as the task description. 

In order to remember assigned tasks, they are often made note of in lists. Traditionally, these lists have been written on small notes (e.g. post-its), but in recent years there have been a large number of todo-apps developed for phones and computers, replacing its analogue predecessor. See [related concepts](#related-concepts) for more on to-do lists.

Once a task is assigned to a person, the person is expected to carry out the task until completion. There is often a time-limit associated with a task, and a failure to complete the task within the time-limit might be unacceptable and as unfavorable as not completing the task at all.

## Examples

1. Many young children are given chores around the house, such as taking out the trash or cleaning their room.
2. All employees have a set of tasks to complete, which are often defined in their contract or verbally during their training.
