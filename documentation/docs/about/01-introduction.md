# Introduction

## The purpose of the template

This is a solution template for creating a Single Page App (SPA) with React and FastAPI following the principles of Clean Architecture.

The template provides an example implementation of a todo application. The todo app implementation is fairly basic. A user can add a task, mark a task as completed and delete an added task. The purpose of the minimalist todo app implementation is to learn and practice what the concepts of [clean architecture](../contribute/development-guide/coding/01-architecture.md) are, and how they can be used in a REST API.
