Feature flags
=============

Note: This section is under progress...

Features are merged into trunk (main branch), but are disabled via feature flags.

### Feature flags

As the trunk (main branch) is always kept ready for release, feature flags help decouple deployment from release so any changes that are not ready can be wrapped in a feature flag and kept hidden while features that are complete can be released to end-users without delay.
